This script is used for scraping MLB (Major League Baseball) player proposition statistics from BettingPros.com for sports betting analysis. Specifically, it:
Collects player prop betting data (like over/under lines for home runs, hits, runs, etc.)
Extracts recent player performance statistics from their individual pages
Calculates players' historical averages for the selected stats
Differentiates between home and away game performance
Compiles all data into organized CSV files for betting analysis
The script allows users to select which specific statistics they want to track (home runs, hits, RBIs, etc.) and how many recent games to analyze. It creates separate CSV files for each statistic containing player names, betting lines, odds, projections, and historical performance data.
This tool would be used by sports bettors or analysts looking to identify potential value in player prop betting markets by comparing the betting lines to players' recent performance metrics.
